= Experimental terminal emulator

"Terminix" is an experimental terminal emulator.
This is a for-fun project and if you want a _good_ terminal emulator you should probably look elsewhere.
This one is basically unusable.

It uses the GNU Unifont and _only_ the Unifont at the moment, so if you don't like that font... well...

You can print Klingon, so that's cool.

== Dependencies

* https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW]
* http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html[GNU Unifont]

== Build Instructions

Terminix embeds the GNU Unifont directly into its executable.
In order to do so, download and extract the Unifont's source code and extract it into a directory titled "unifont" in the same directory as this README.
Then, run `./buildfont.rb` to compile the Unifont into `src/unifont.c`.

Run `./build.sh` to compile the program.
To execute the program, run `./terminix`.

== Bugs

More than you can count.

* It sets `TERM` to `vt100` despite not truly being compatible, as many escape codes are unavailable.
* Lots of things are hard-coded so I could just get this working.
* Its a huge kludge of TODO's and disorganized code.

But hey, ViM works now.

== Special Thanks

Special thanks to Paul Flo Williams, who's article on DEC-compatible ANSI escape code parsers is the only reason this exists.
The flow chart is amazing!
If you look in `vtinterp.c`, you can see how directly I followed it (although this implementation is far from perfect).
Check it out: https://vt100.net/emu/dec_ansi_parser

I would've used https://github.com/haberman/vtparse[Josh Haberman's public domain implementation], linked to from the article, but most of the fun of this project has been hand-coding an interpreter so it would've been way less enjoyable.

WARNING: The following details are based on my best effort interpretation of the license terms for the GNU Unifont.
I am not a lawyer, so I don't know if this is a correct interpretation of the Unifont's license.
Please seek professional legal advice in order to make sure you properly comply with Unifont's license terms.
Eventually I will contact the Free Software Foundation, GNU Project, and/or GNU Unifont developers to make sure I am properly interpreting this.

The resulting binary will include a compiled version of the GNU Unifont.
_I think_ the resulting binary will be covered by the GNU General Public License version 2 or later, with the Unifont's embedding exception.
The exact license text for the Unifont can be found in its distribution, and _I think_ it must be distributed with all copies of the resulting binary.

I am not including a copy of the license here in case you use a version of the GNU Unifont with slightly (or extremely) different license terms.
Please see the Unifont distribution you download to build Terminix for its license terms.
